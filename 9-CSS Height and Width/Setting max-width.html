        Setting max-width
The max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.

The max-width can be specified in length values, like px, cm, etc., or in percent (%) of the containing block, or set to none (this is default. Means that there is no maximum width).

The problem with the
 (div) 
     above occurs when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element (500px). The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.

Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling of small windows.

Tip: Drag the browser window to smaller than 500px wide, to see the difference between the two divs!

This element has a height of 100 pixels and a max-width of 500 pixels.
Note: The value of the max-width property overrides width.

The following example shows a (div) element with a height of 100 pixels and a max-width of 500 pixels:

Example
div {
    max-width: 500px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: powderblue;
}
