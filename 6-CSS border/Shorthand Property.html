    As you can see from the examples above, there are many properties to consider when dealing with borders.

To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the individual border properties in one property.

The border property is a shorthand property for the following individual border properties:

border-width
border-style (required)
border-color
Example
p {
    border: 5px solid red;
}
</pre>
